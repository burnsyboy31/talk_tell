Right now it is just setup to pull earnings call transcript data from Motley Fool. You need to grab the earnings call transcripts you are interested in from Motley fool and pinput them into sample_urls.txt file.

Then it will scrape and parse these transcripts into the combined_transctipts.parquet file, use parquet viewer to review this. 

Plan to build out analysis framework soon!
